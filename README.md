## A simple implementation for AutoEncoder using AlexNet for Encoder

### Task :
- [x] Build a **abstract class** of AutoEncoder
- [x] Build a pipeline to input dataset (MNIST), (CIFAR10)
- [x] Build a Encoder with **AlexNet** Architecture
- [x] ~~Build a Decoder with 2 simple FC layers~~
- [ ] Build a Decoder with architecture from [Siyi Guo](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1379189) 
- [x] Build a Optimizer for training (scheduler)
- [x] Build a loss function for SimpleAutoEncoder
- [ ] Fix a problem in logical kernel_size between Encoder and Decoder (Use a list to store all size in conv step)
